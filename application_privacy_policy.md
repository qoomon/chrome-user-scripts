# Application Privacy Policy

This Privacy Policy applies to the use of the **Chrome User Scripts** OAuth App (the "App") which facilitates data synchronization for the associated browser extension.

## 1. Data Collection and Usage

**The browser extension and the App do not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information (PII) or user content other than the files required for extension synchronization.**

The extension is designed to run locally within your browser and does not have an independent server or database for user data collection.

## 2. Google Drive Data Access

The App utilizes Google's OAuth services exclusively for the purpose of synchronizing internal extension configuration and data across your installations.

- **Scope Used:** The App requests and uses the `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.appdata` scope.

- **Purpose:** This scope allows the App to read and write data to a hidden folder on your Google Drive designated specifically for application data. This data is used solely to keep your extension settings and files in sync.

- **No Access to User Files: The App cannot access, modify, or view any of your personnel files, documents, or data stored outside the designated App Data folder on Google Drive.**

## 3. Changes to this Policy

We may update this policy periodically. We will notify you of any significant changes by updating the policy date and description where required by platform policies.

**Effective Date:** November 17, 2025
